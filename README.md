# Eyes-exercise
Project with illustrated eyes that move with mouse

# How to View
Click "Code" above files

Select "download Zip"

Once downloaded, extract all files

Drag the HTML file to a new browser on your machine

Move mouse around to see eyeballs follow the mouse direction

# Further Improvements/Changes
I would like to add another set of eyes that move in the opposite direction the mouse is moved.
